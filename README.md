# vba_macros
A couple short macros I wrote in Visual Basic to aid with the processing and formatting of reports.

Nothing particularly fancy here, some simple macros that reformat reports. Of note in the code: a timer to determine runtime and potential bottlenecking, and a dynamic method of autofilling formulas based on row count of a particular column.
